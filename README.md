### Language feature roadmap overview

The following features are to be implemented:

* Static typing.
* Function overloading.
* Typed function pointers (return type is strongly typed, argument type and number is dynamic).
* Object oriented programming.
* Overloadable operators for user-defined types.
* Manual memory management (`_new()` and `_delete()` functions) for long-lived objects.
